# Vitruvian proportions

A very light university assignement to check if the [Vitruvian man](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vitruvian_Man) proportions applied to our class. We began by measuring ourselves and computing the [principal components](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Principal_component_analysis) of the said measures.
